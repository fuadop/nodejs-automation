# nodejs-automation
a nodejs server that fetches data of items in my youtube playlist and then searches for the item in spotify and adds them to my spotify favourite playlist.

# Explore youtube api
  I went over to youtube api documentation and made some research. I got my api key and my oath token and fetched my data, precisely fetched the data of one of my playlist
  
# Explore Spotify api
  Did the exact same thing as the youtube api
  
# The Script
  it checks my youtube playlist for videos and searches the videos title through spotify api then grabs the uri .
  it then adds the uri to my spotify playlist.
  
I saw something similar, but the person used python and i have never used any python package other than pandas and random.. soi decided to do it in the framework i love most(node js).
